# Create a Tic-Tac-Toe Game in React

_From Hackajob Pathway_

## Requirements

Build an interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game with React.

- The board should contain 9 clickable elements in a 3x3 grid. Each element should have a class called square and could take one of the following values(X or O) when is clicked.
- The game status should be inside a div element with class status.
  The game status text could be one of the following: Next player: X, Next player: O, Winner: X, Winner: O, Tie.
- There should be a reset button which resets all cell values. The button should have a class reset.
- When the game starts the status should be Next player: X and after one of the cell is clicked the status will change into: Next player: O and so on.
- The game winner is decided when the first player scores 3 marks in a row(up, down or diagonally).
- If no player scores 3 marks in a row the game ends in a tie.

We are testing if the App is working based on what classes are added on the elements. Make sure you are creating the elements using only the classes mentioned above.
